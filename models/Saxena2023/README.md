The folder contains the world builder files representing the different plate boundary models. These models were used to
develop the global mantle flow models of Saxena et al., 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JB025877). 
Below is the brief description of the model files:

1) gem_plate_boundary_model.wb   : This file contains faults from the Global earthquake model available at
	    https://github.com/GEMScienceTools/gem-global-active-faults. 

2) nuvel_plate_boundary_model.wb : This file contains the NUVEL plate boundary model (Argus and Gordon, 1991).

3) bird_plate_boundary_model.wb  : This file describes Peter Bird's 2003 plate boundary model as discrete 
       polygons/steps.
